This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable and immutable borrows.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create both mutable and immutable references to the same variable simultaneously, which is forbidden by Rust's borrow checker.  The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to correctly handle this situation, either by using multiple variables or cloning.
